building instructions:

run these commands
-bash-4.1$ cc one.c -o one
-bash-4.1$ cc three.c -o three
-bash-4.1$ cc main.c -o main
-bash-4.1$ ./main ./afile.txt ./afile.txt


logic / pseudo  code:


check user input
run three programs
print the Exit values of the programs


program one
    
    intialise max value
    loop 10 times
        get valid input from user
        compare max value with current value
            replace if larger

    print maxValue
    return maxValue

    

program three

    read file1 1 char at a time
    
        copying non alpha characters straight to file2

        combine alpha characters into string
            if string is equal to "execute" or "study"
                replace with "run" or "examine" respectively
        copy string to file2

    
    add Phrase to start of file 1

    copy file 2 to file 1




test plan
    -check various input fails from user
    -check works correctly with correct inputs
