4. How do we create a new process? How can a process determine if it is the parent process

A fork() system call creates a child process. The child
process begins its life not at the start of main but at the return
from fork
• We need to distinguish the new process from the original one.
In the child process, fork() returns 0. In the parent process,
fork() returns a positive value 

5. Describe how a parent process can communicate with its child process. (1%)
• A process sends a signal to another process by using the kill
system call
• when the child calls exit, the kernel wakes up the parent and
delivers the value the child passed to exit
